<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a student in the ninth cohort of the Master of Behavioral and Decision Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my BSc (Hons) in Information Management and Information Systems from Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) and the University of Liverpool in 2025. My research has been presented at major international conferences, including PACIS and INFORMS, and I have served as a reviewer for conferences such as ICIS, ECIS, and ACM CHI.

My research focuses on how large language models (LLMs) and other emerging technologies are deployed on online platforms and how they systematically shape human behavior and digital interactions. I am particularly interested in the underlying mechanisms through which these technologies operate across different platform contexts, as well as how micro-level cues, such as linguistic framing, tags, and emojis influence online word-of-mouth, user engagement, and reputation formation. Methodologically, I combine machine learning, text analysis, econometric modeling, and both online and laboratory experiments to identify and test the behavioral mechanisms underlying these phenomena.

*I am currently seeking a research assistantship at a North American business school and exploring **PhD opportunities for Fall 2027 entry** in **Information Systems, empirical and behavioral Operations Management, or Quantitative Marketing**. I welcome opportunities to connect with scholars whose research interests align with mine.*
