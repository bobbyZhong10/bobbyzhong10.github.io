<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a student in the ninth cohort of the [Master of Behavioral and Decision Sciences](https://www.lps.upenn.edu/degree-programs/mbds) at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my BSc (Hons) in Information Management and Information Systems from [Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) and the University of Liverpool in 2025, advised by [Prof. Xuezhong (Tony) He](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/XuezhongHe/). My research has been presented at major international conferences, including PACIS and INFORMS.

My academic training has taken place in interdisciplinary research settings spanning information systems, finance, and computer science. I currently collaborate closely with [Dr. Jiding Zhang](https://jidingz.github.io/) at Arizona State University and [Dr. Simin Li](https://siminli.wp.tulane.edu/) at Tulane University on research examining AI-generated review summaries (AIGS) in online platforms. In parallel, I have worked with [Dr. Bingjie Deng](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/BingjieDeng/) at XJTLU since my undergraduate studies, primarily using experimental methods to investigate how human–computer interaction influences user behavior across online platforms. Earlier in my training, I conducted research on large language models for market information analysis and prediction at the Department of Finance at XJTLU under the supervision of [Dr. Jia Zhai](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/JiaZhai/) and [Dr. Shimeng Shi](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ShimengShi/). In addition, I developed a training data preprocessing framework for large language models under the supervision of [Prof. Dapeng Tao](https://www.ise.ynu.edu.cn/faculty/68/) at Yunnan University.

My research examines how generative artificial intelligence, including large language models (LLMs), and related digital technologies are deployed on online platforms to reshape information environments and influence outcomes in digital markets. I study the mechanisms through which these technologies transform how information is generated, filtered, and presented across different platform contexts, and how micro-level information cues such as linguistic framing, tags, and emojis shape online word-of-mouth, user engagement, and reputation formation. Methodologically, I combine machine learning and text analysis with econometric modeling, as well as online and laboratory experiments, to identify and test the behavioral mechanisms through which changes in information structure translate into observable market and interaction outcomes.

💡 *I am currently exploring **US PhD opportunities at business schools for Fall 2027 entry** in **Information Systems, Empirical Operations Management, or Quantitative Marketing**. I welcome opportunities to connect with scholars whose research interests align with mine.*
