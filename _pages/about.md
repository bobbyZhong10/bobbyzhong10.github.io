<section class="home-intro-card">
I am a student in the ninth cohort of the [Master of Behavioral and Decision Sciences](https://www.lps.upenn.edu/degree-programs/mbds) at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my BSc (Hons) in Information Management and Information Systems from [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) and the University of Liverpool in 2025, advised by [Prof. Xuezhong (Tony) He](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/XuezhongHe/). My research has been presented at premier conferences, including PACIS and INFORMS.

My academic training spans interdisciplinary research in information systems, finance, and computer science. I currently collaborate with [Dr. Jiding Zhang](https://jidingz.github.io/) at Arizona State University and [Dr. Simin Li](https://siminli.wp.tulane.edu/) at Tulane University on projects that examine AI generated review summaries and their implications for information provision on digital platforms. In parallel, I work with [Dr. Bingjie Deng](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/BingjieDeng/) at XJTLU, continuing a collaboration that began during my undergraduate studies and applies experimental methods to study human computer interaction and user behavior in online environments. Earlier in my training, I conducted research on large language models for market information analysis and prediction in the Department of Finance at XJTLU under the supervision of [Dr. Jia Zhai](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/JiaZhai) and [Dr. Shimeng Shi](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ShimengShi/). In addition, under the supervision of [Prof. Dapeng Tao](https://www.ise.ynu.edu.cn/faculty/68/) at Yunnan University, I contributed to the development of core components of large language model training pipelines, which strengthened my foundation in artificial intelligence development and applied machine learning. Complementing this technical training, I completed the Research Seminar in Information Systems at the Wharton School, with a focus on the economics of information systems.

My research examines how generative artificial intelligence and related digital technologies transform information environments and economic outcomes on digital platforms. I study how content generation, aggregation, and filtering enabled by artificial intelligence alter the visibility, salience, and distribution of user-generated information. I further analyze how micro-level informational cues, including linguistic framing, tags, and emojis, interact with these technological processes to influence online word of mouth, user engagement, and the formation of reputation. In terms of methodology, I combine econometric analysis with machine learning techniques and annotation based on large language models. I also conduct online and field experiments to identify causal mechanisms and behavioral responses.
