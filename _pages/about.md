I am a student in the ninth cohort of the [Master of Behavioral and Decision Sciences](https://www.lps.upenn.edu/degree-programs/mbds) at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my BSc (Hons) in Information Management and Information Systems from [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) and the University of Liverpool in 2025, advised by [Prof. Xuezhong (Tony) He](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/XuezhongHe/). My research has been presented at premier conferences, including PACIS and INFORMS.

My academic training spans interdisciplinary research in information systems, finance, and computer science. I currently collaborate with [Dr. Jiding Zhang](https://jidingz.github.io/) at Arizona State University and [Dr. Simin Li](https://siminli.wp.tulane.edu/) at Tulane University on research examining AI-generated review summaries (AIGS) and their implications for information provision on digital platforms. In parallel, I work with [Dr. Bingjie Deng](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/BingjieDeng/) at XJTLU, building on an ongoing collaboration since my undergraduate studies that uses experimental methods to study human–computer interaction and user behavior in online environments. Earlier in my training, I conducted research on large language models for market information analysis and prediction in the Department of Finance at XJTLU under the supervision of [Dr. Jia Zhai](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/JiaZhai) and [Dr. Shimeng Shi](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ShimengShi/). In addition, under the supervision of [Prof. Dapeng Tao](https://www.ise.ynu.edu.cn/faculty/68/) at Yunnan University, I worked on core components of large language model training pipelines, strengthening my foundation in AI system development and applied machine learning. Complementing this technical training, I also took the Research Seminar in Information Systems at the Wharton School, which focused on the economics of information systems.

My research examines how generative artificial intelligence and related digital technologies reshape information environments and economic outcomes on digital platforms. I investigate how AI-driven content generation, aggregation, and filtering reconfigure the visibility and distribution of user-generated information, and how micro-level information cues such as linguistic framing, tags, and emojis interact with these changes to influence online word-of-mouth, user engagement, and reputation formation. Methodologically, I combine machine learning and text analysis with econometric modeling, as well as online and laboratory experiments.

💡 *I am currently exploring **US PhD opportunities at business schools for Fall 2027 entry** in **Information Systems**. Also willing to learn about the opportunities of Empirical Operations Management, or Quantitative Marketing. I welcome opportunities to connect with scholars whose research interests align with mine.*
