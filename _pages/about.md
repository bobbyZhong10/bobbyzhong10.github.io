  <h1 class="home-hero__title">Researching how generative AI reshapes information environments, user behavior, and market outcomes on digital platforms.</h1>
  <p class="home-hero__lead">I am a master's student in Behavioral and Decision Sciences at the <a href="https://www.lps.upenn.edu/degree-programs/mbds">University of Pennsylvania</a>. My work sits at the intersection of information systems, platform economics, and computational social science.</p>
  <p class="home-hero__lead">I study how AI-generated content, recommendation and aggregation systems, and micro-level communication cues influence visibility, trust, engagement, and reputation. Methodologically, I combine econometrics, machine learning, LLM-assisted annotation, and experiments.</p>
